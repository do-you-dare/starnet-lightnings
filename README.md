# STARNET lightning data analysis

Those are some programs and scripts I did to analyze data about lightnings provided by [STARNET](http://www.zeus.iag.usp.br).

## Usage

Download the data from starnet and put it on a folder named `data`. Check the `Makefile` for options. It is still a work in progress.
